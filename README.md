# Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a neural network model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (legitimate). The model processes SMS text data, learning patterns in the messages to accurately predict their category. The goal is to create an effective spam filter that can be used for real-world SMS spam detection applications.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data processing and model implementation.
TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries for building, training, and evaluating the neural network model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data trends and metrics.
Scikit-Learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques used to process and tokenize text data.
